    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p id="ourStory">The Cupcake Bakery has been a tradition in Orange County since 1956 and
      as French’s Cupcake Bakery since 1976. It is family owned and operated,
      and founded by Jerry and Dianne French. All of our baked goods are made
      on the premises using time-honored recipes by our skilled staff. Always
      fresh, always ready and always delicious. The French family baking
      tradition dates back to 1929 in Hicksville, Ohio, where Jerry French’s
      great uncle opened a bakery. For nine years, Jerry’s grandfather, Ralph
      Seely, worked there perfecting his skills and opened his own bakery in
      1938. In 1956, the family and business relocated to Santa Ana, CA.</p>
